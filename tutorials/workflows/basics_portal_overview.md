The navigation bar provides fast access to the different pages of the portal.

__Workflows__
- The tabs __Available workflows__, __Running workflows__ and __Finished workflows__ lead to overviews of the respective kind of workflows.

__Workflow Editor__
- The Workflow Editor provides functionality to create and edit workflows, to add new services to the portal, and to delete services and workflows from the portal.
- It will be utilized in the tutorials [Basic workflow editing](tutorials/workflows/basics_editing.md) and [Registration of new services](tutorials/workflows/basics_service_registration.md).

__Log out__
 - Using this button, the current user can be logged out and the browser will be redirected to the login.

## Step 2 - Inspecting available workflows
1. Select __Available workflows__ in the navigation bar, which will lead you to the following view, listing all available workflows:
