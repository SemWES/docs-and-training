### Calculator
**Workflow name and URI:** Demo_Calculator (http://demo/workflow/Demo_Calculator.owl#Demo_Calculator)<br/>
**Requires login with demo project:** No

This workflow showcases the multiplication of two numbers entered by the user.
It demonstrates simple user input as well as the usage of synchronous services.

Also see the accompanying [calculator
tutorial](../tutorials/services/python_sync_calculator.md) and full
[calculator code example](../code_examples/Python/sync_calculator).

### Waiter
**Workflow name and URI:** Demo_Waiter (http://demo/workflow/Demo_Waiter.owl#Demo_Waiter)<br/>
**Requires login with demo project:** No

This workflow demonstrates a simple asynchronous service, which does nothing
but waiting for a defined time. While not very spectacular in itself, it
showcases how asynchronous services can have detailed HTML status reports.

Also see the accompanying [waiter
tutorial](../tutorials/services/python_async_waiter.md) and full [waiter code
example](../code_examples/Python/async_waiter).
